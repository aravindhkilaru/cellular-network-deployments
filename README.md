**To implement a Cellular Network Layout for various coverage scenarios:**
  ● Urban Micro (UMi).
  ● Urban Macro (UMa).
  ● Sub-Urban Macro (SMa)
  ● Rural Macro (RMa).
  ● Indoor Factory (InF).



**Evaluate the characteristics and performance of Cellular Network Layouts:**
  ● Calculation of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR),
  ● Calculation of Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP),
  ● Path Loss Analysis,
  ● Connection Density,
  ● Area Traffic Capacity,
  ● Control plane latency calculation,
  ● User plane latency calculation,
  ● Data Rate,
    o User Experienced Data Rate (throughput).
  ● Air Interface Latency,
  ● Average Spectral Efficiency,
  ● 5th Percentile User Spectral Efficiency (CDF): The cumulative distribution function
  representing the spectral efficiency experienced by the users.
